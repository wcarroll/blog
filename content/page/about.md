Hello, Visitor!
My Name is Wes Carroll and I have been dabbling with computers in one form or another since the late 1980's when my father brought home our first "[IBM PC-Compatible clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_(computing)#Hardware_clones)."
I thought that it was the most amazing thing in the world and I was hooked from day one.
I remember he setup a program that would run when I hit ```g``` then ```enter``` and a whole list of games would appear on the screen.
All I had to do was select the number of the game I wanted to play and in a few seconds I was in the world of [_Kings Quest_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I)!

Over the years, I started to become more curious about what else could I do with a computer.
Typing in a letter or two was good and all, but what else could this machine do?
Going through the alphabet letter by letter and hitting ```enter``` after each one seemed like a good idea at the time.
This process quickly taught me how to find inputs that were not ```recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.```
Soon I was trying to remember key combinations I had seen my father use and eventually I discovered the ```dir``` and ```cd``` commands.
This discovery led navigating the filesystem and attempting to execute every program I could find.
Everything was going so well, right until I discovered the ```del``` command.

Soon after discovering ```del``` I was introduced to the world of backup and recovery.
I remember my father taking it all in stride as I told him that I had issued a command to delete everything in the directory that happened to contain the ```del``` command by typing in ```del *.*```.
He calmly left the computer room and brought back a box that contained several [5.25 inch floppy disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk#8-inch_and_5%C2%BC-inch_disks). Over the next several hours, we were able to get the computer back to a running state.

My first summer job was working as a Junior Computer Technician for a company with about 50 employees assisting with all things computer including my first server!
I continued to hone my skills and learn everything I could eventually obtaining several certifications and getting my first full time job as a Junior Systems Administrator.
Since then, I have had several jobs in technology being responsible for just about anything technology related including servers, storage, networking, directory services, e-mail, etc.

In early 2015, I left the Systems Architecture \ Engineering \ Administrator role and took a job as a Pre-Sales Engineer for a VAR and entered the world of consultation and design.
While I enjoyed my time as a Systems Engineer and getting my hands dirty, moving into a consultative role is where I found my passion.
Having the opportunity to understand individual needs and help others solve complex problems makes each day a new and exciting prospect.

Today, I work for [Zerto](https://www.zerto.com) as a Pre-Sales Engineer helping companies understand IT resiliency concepts and where Zerto can help with these goals and objectives.
As my daily job does focus around IT resiliency, most of the blog will focus around the Zerto Virtual Replication platform and encompassing technologies.
I look forward to sharing my knowledge and insights with my audience.
If there is something specific you have a question about or would like to see me cover, please do not hesitate to reach out.
