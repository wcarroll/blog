Hello, Visitor! My Name is Wes Carroll and I have been dabbling with computers in one form or another since the late 1980's when my father brought home our first "[IBM PC-Compatiable clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_(computing)#Hardware_clones)." I thought that it was the most amazing thing in the world and I was hooked from day one. I remember he setup a program that would run when I hit ```g``` then ```enter``` and a whole list of games would appear on the screen. All I had to do was select the number of the game I wanted to play and in a few seconds, I was ready to go!

Over the years, I started to become more curious about what else could I do with a computer. Typing in a letter or two was good and all, but what else could this machine do? Going through the alaphbet letter by letter and hitting ```enter``` after each one seemed like a good idea at the time. This process quickly taught me how to find inputs that were not ```recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.```

To Be Continued...
