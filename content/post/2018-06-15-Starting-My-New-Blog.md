For a while now, I have been looking to start a site \ blog to share with the world my technological learnings and insights.
One of the hardest things I had to figure out was what to call the site.
I wanted something that would be easy to remember, unique, and most importantly not already taken.
Considering all these requirements, I spent over a year attempting to figure it out!

As you can see, I ended up with __Interrupt Request__ as my choice.
For those of you who don't know, an Interrupt Request (or IRQ) is a computer hardware signal that is used to temporarily stop a running program.
Typically, these interrupt requests are used to let the computer know that data or input needs to be received by a source outside of the running program.
In today's world, IRQs are not something that the typical computer geek needs to deal with, but back when I started tinkering with computers, you had to make sure your IRQ settings did not conflict or you could end up with several non-functioning pieces of hardware.

I am working towards making this site an Interrupt Request of sorts so that when my readers see a new post or need to reference something I have written about on this site, they will interrupt their normal IO stream and find my site for some additional data input.
