For a while now, I have been looking to start a site \ blog to share with the world my technological learnings and insights. One of the hardest things I had to figure out was what to call the site. I wanted something that would be easy to remember, unique, and most imporantly not already taken. Considering all these requirements, I spend over a year attempting to figure it out!

As you can see, I ended up with __Interrupt Request__ as my choice. For those of you who don't know, an Interrupt Request (or IRQ) is a hardware signal that is used to temporarly stop a running program. Typically, these interrupt requests are used to let the computer know that data needs to be recieved by an outside source. In today's world, IRQs are not something that the typical computer geek needs to deal with, but back when I started tinkering with computers, you had to make sure your IRQ settings did not conflict or you could end up with several non-functional pieces of hardware.

I am working towards making this site an Interrupt Request of sorts so that when my readers see a new post or need to reference something I have written about on this site, they will interrupt their normal IO stream and find my site for some additional data input.
